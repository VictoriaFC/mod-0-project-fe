## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * I have finally accepted that making mistakes is essential to learning. As someone who tends to be on the more self-conscious side I've always struggled with "failing" or making mistakes.
  * S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goals are new to me. I think practicing setting these goals will be a great way to better my growth mindset!


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I demonstrate a growth mindset by not being afraid to seek help. In my career it has often been frowned upon to ask for help, it has taken me years to overcome this and to be more vulnerable in the workspace by asking for help when needed.
  * I don't typically gravitate towards challenges, it's very intimidating for me to dive into something I'm not familiar with. Working on this throughout my time at Turing will be crucial!


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  * I was comfortable going through this section when it came to terminal commands. I think the more vague instructions gave me a chance to exercise my memory and it proved that section0/1 information stuck with me!


4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  * Conditional Statement: evaluate to `true` or `false`. You use comparison operators in JavaScript to determine whether something is true or false.
  * Daily life example: If I'm tired, drink coffee. If I workout, take a shower.
  * Web application: Alarm clock app
    - If you hit snooze it adds 5 mins to the timer
    - If you hit dismiss it stops the timer


5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
  * You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using the if/else if/else structure. You give one condition to start, if that is not true it moves on to the `else if` condition. If that is not true it moves on `else` which has no condition.
  

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  * Console.log, debugger, etc.


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  * I don't know what I don't know... :) Sorry I don't have a specific question. Just overall need more practice to get more comfortable with `if` statements.

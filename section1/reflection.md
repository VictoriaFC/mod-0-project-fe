## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?  

    I feel good about asking questions! I think I tend to wait a little too long but I will actively be reminding myself that it's good to ask questions.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
I learned about the following data types:
 - Strings: a string of characters
 - Numbers: a count of numbers
 - Booleans: one of two answers, yes/no aka true/false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?  
    You would use `// OR /* */`

    Purpose: To provide an explanation of the code that doesn't affect the code/Javascript.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

   You can think of a variable as a bucket. When you declare the bucket, it is empty. It can store anything you want! Sand, rocks, etc. The contents can be dumped out and filled with something else.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
    - App: Instagram
    - 3 Variables & Data Types
      - Comments - string
      - Likes - number  
      - Bio - string

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

    Concatenation is combining multiple strings.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

    Any site where a sentence changes per user. In example, if a site welcomes the user by their name.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

    I don't fully understand the point of == vs ===. When would you use ==?

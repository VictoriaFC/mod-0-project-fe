## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
  * It felt frustrating but I guess it helped me challenge myself.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * Calm: An array would be used to list out the different audio file names that a user could fall asleep to.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  * Array methods are used to change or interact with an array. I.e. pop, push, shift, unshift are all array methods that are used to accomplish different outcomes within an array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  * Loops are used to avoid repetitive code. If you didn't use a loop you would have to write out an array multiple times and run the code over and over again to achieve the same outcome as a loop.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  * Cafeteria Lines:
    - You have 10 students to feed so you'll need 10 trays.
    - Each time you fill the tray with food then you add the next tray to be filled.
    - Once all 10 trays have been filled with food you know there is no more food to be served.   

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  * I don't have a specific question. Just wondering how long it will take me to get more comfortable working with loops? :)
